# A nutritional and fitness Bot!

## This taught me how to work with different API's and Telegram bot commands

### - Use /start or /hello to greet the bot
### - Use /help to get a list of commands that the bot can do 
### - Use /calories to get the number of calories in your favorite food
### - Use /fitness to get your bmi and relevant exercises for you
